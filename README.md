Pastecode manages pastecodes - your small text snippets. Just a extermely simple alternative to pastebin (dislike its UI).
Feel free to checkout templates for details. K8s friendly.


## Deployment
Please checkout my home page for actual deployment of the service.


## Makefile
Makefile automates boring stuff. Just run with specific target.
